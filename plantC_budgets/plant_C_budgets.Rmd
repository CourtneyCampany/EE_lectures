## Plant Carbon Budgets / NPP
<hr>
<br />

* **carbon “metabolism” of Earth’s vegetation** They show 
  + plants convert carbon dioxide into sugar molecules for food.
  + this process also provide the oxygen we need to breathe 
  + plants provide the energy and air required by most life forms on Earth.
  
* <strong><span style="color:green">Net Primary Productivity</span></strong> 
  + how much CO<sub>2</sub> vegetation takes in during photosynthesis 
  + minus how much CO<sub>2</sub> the plants release through respiration 
  
* **Respiration** 
  + metabolic process of using sugars and starches for energy 
  + construction and maintenance respiration (in plants)

## The hunt for the world’s missing carbon

Researchers are racing to determine whether forests will continue to act as a brake on climate change by soaking up more carbon.

## NPP: Biomes
<hr>
<br />

* In mid-latitudes, NPP is tied to seasonal change 
* boreal forests have high productivity in June and July, then decline 
* Tropical forests have year-round high productivity 

* Due mainly to which state factor?

## Plant respiration
<hr>
<br />

* Photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide and produces oxygen
* Respiration uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide. 

* Plants respire all the time, whether it is dark or light. 
* They photosynthesise only when they are in the light.

+ Photosynthesis usually results in a net glucose gain
  + accounting for respiration
  + increase in plant biomass
