<div style="float: left; width: 55%;">

* **Terrestrial biosphere responds to rising [CO<sub>2</sub>]**
      + fundamental role in rate of global change
      + Photosynthesis removes CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere
      + Respiration by plants and heterotrophs add it back.
      
<br/>

* **Plants respond to rising [CO<sub>2</sub>] through ↑ photosynthesis and ↓ transpiration**
      + what greenhouse experiments tell us

<br/>
      
* **Techonology to grow plants in the field at a controlled [CO<sub>2</sub>] under open-air conditions** 
      + better estimate of plant and ecosystem response to a high CO<sub>2</sub> world

## Free-air CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment experiments (FACE)
<hr>
<br/>

<div style="float: right; width: 55%;">

* **Circular plots surrounded by a ring of pipes**
      + release ambient or enriched CO<sub>2</sub>
      + @ vertical intervals through plant canopy. 

<br/>

* **Wind direction/velocity and [CO<sub>2</sub>] are measured at the center of each plot**
      + computers adjust CO<sub>2</sub> flow rate to maintain target
      + Pipes on the upwind side of the plots release CO<sub>2</sub>

<br/>
      
 * **Utilized with some variationss in numerous large-scale experiments**
    + up to 30m diameter plots
    + vegetation up to 25 meters

</div>

## Brookhaven National Lab: FACE Specs
<hr>
<br/>

<div style="float: right; width: 50%;">

* **Circular systems designed to allow open-air exposures to CO<sub>2</sub>, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and ozone**
    + uniform exposures of gases to large field plots
    
<br/>

* **Liquid CO<sub>2</sub> is piped from storage tanks to heat exchangers to vaporize the CO2**
       + CO<sub>2</sub> is typically obtained as a by-product fertilizer manufacturing 
       
<br/>

* **Gaseous CO<sub>2</sub> is channeled through pipes by pressure regulators to each FACE plot**
    + 24 to 32 vertical standing vent pipes for emitting CO<sub>2</sub>

## Advantages of FACE
<hr>
<br/>

<div style="float: left; width: 45%;">

* **Investigation of undisturbed ecosystems**
      + natural light, temperature, wind & precipitation
      + natural interactions with pathogens and insects
      + applicable to natural and agriculture systems

<br/>

* **Integrated measurements of plant and ecosystem processes simultaneously**
    + avoids problems with edge effects
    + plants studied throughout life cycle, 
    + trees have enough space to develop to canopy closure
