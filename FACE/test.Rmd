* **terrestrial biosphere is not just a passive respondent to rising [CO<sub>2</sub>]**
      + fundamental role in determining the rate of global change.**
      + Photosynthesis removes CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere and respiration by plants and heterotrophs add it back.
      
<br/>

* **Plants respond to rising [CO<sub>2</sub>] through increased photosynthesis and reduced transpiration**
      + this is what greenhouse experiments say
      
* **FACE was developed as a means to grow plants in the field at a controlled elevation of [CO<sub>2</sub>] under fully open-air conditions** 
      + provide better estimate of how plants and ecosystems will respond in a future high CO<sub>2</sub> world

## What is FACE?
<hr>
<br/>

<div class="centered"><strong><span style="color:green">
Free-air CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment experiments</span></strong></div>

* **circular plots surrounded by a ring of pipes that release ambient or enriched CO<sub>2</sub>**
      + vertical intervals through plant canopy. 

* **Wind direction, wind velocity, and [CO<sub>2</sub>] are measured at the center of each plot**
      + computer-controlled system to adjusts CO<sub>2</sub> flow rate to maintain targe
      + Pipes on the upwind side of the plots release CO<sub>2</sub>, 
      
 * **This design has been utilized with some variations and technical developments in numerous large-scale experiments**
    + up to 30m diameter plots
    + vegetation up to 25 meters

## Brookhaven National Lab: FACE Specs

* **Circular systems with computer feedback control designed to allow open-air exposures to CO<sub>2</sub>, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and ozone**
    + unifrom exposures of gases to large field plots

* **Liquid CO<sub>2</sub> is piped from the storage tank to heat exchangers which vaporize the CO2 as needed**
       + CO<sub>2</sub> is typically obtained as a by-product from the manufacture of agricultural fertilizer 

* **Gaseous CO<sub>2</sub> is channeled through pipes and pressure regulators to the FACE plot**
    + 24 to 32 vertical standing vent pipes for emitting CO<sub>2</sub>

## Advantages of FACE
<hr>
<br/

* **Investigation of undisturbed ecosystems**
      + natural interactions with light, temperature, wind, precipitation, pathogens and insects
      + applicable to natural and agriculture systems
      
* **Integrated measurements of plant and ecosystem processes simultaneously**
    + large plot sizes
    + avoids problems with edge effects
    + plants studied throughout life cycle, 
    + trees have enough space to develop to canopy closure
